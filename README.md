## **Problem Statement**

*#GDL9 - Nationwide integration of all pharmaceutical groups (students, industry experts, government employees etc.) to share information and updates related to seminars, workshops, expos etc.*

## **Proposed Solution**

**PharmaConnect** is an android app that gives a common platform to integrate all the pharmaceutical groups together under one umbrella. For a non-exoert, this app also provides many other features.

**WHY MOBILE APP ?**

Because the world is gradually moving towards smaller and smaller devices. With a fast paced focus shift from desktops to laptops and other hand-held devices, an app would perform much better in the market than a website.

## **Features of this app**

1. **News Feeds** - Various credible and verified websites power this module of the app. The news articles and updates are fetched from these websites and displayed appropriately in our app, with notifications enabled for updates. Technically, the major work in this included advanced *web scraping* to obtain the news articles from third-party websites.

2. **Pharmacy Locator** - On a Google Map Layout, using the device's GPS capabilities, this app accurately pin-points to various nearby pharmacies and hospitals.

3. **Surveys** - When the Govt. wants any suggestions or feedbacks on a particular policy bill or update, an employee can create a survey, which can then be floated across the app.

4. **Drug Wiki** - This wiki provides detailes information like common name, generic name, manufacturer details, advantages, side-effects, validity in India etc. about various commonly used drugs. The drug information is stored on a centrally managed cloud server and hence this app functions dynamically.

5. **Policy Updates** - This app also provides latest policy updates from pci.nic.in, an Indian Govt. website. This also involved *web scraping* to fetch the policy list and updates from the remote website.
